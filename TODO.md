# FGShell Feature Roadmap

## Completed
- [x] JSON/YAML output options for commands (ls --json, ls --yaml)

## In Progress
- [ ] Async pipelines - leverage Node.js event loop for better performance
- [ ] Built-in HTTP client - like curl but as a builtin
- [ ] Native Promise/async support - await command syntax
- [ ] Modern globbing - ** for recursive, .gitignore-aware matching
- [ ] Color output by default - don't worry about POSIX conventions
